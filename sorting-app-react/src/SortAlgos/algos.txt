Sure, merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by dividing it into two smaller arrays, sorting those arrays, and then merging the sorted arrays back together.

The basic idea of merge sort is as follows:

- If the array has fewer than 2 elements, return the array (as it's already sorted).
- Split the array into two smaller arrays.
- Recursively sort the two smaller arrays using merge sort.
- Merge the two sorted arrays back together in sorted order.
- Here's an example of how merge sort would work on the array [5, 3, 8, 1, 2, 9, 4, 6]:

The array is split into two smaller arrays: [5, 3, 8, 1] and [2, 9, 4, 6]
Each of these smaller arrays is sorted recursively using merge sort.
The two sorted arrays are merged back together in sorted order: [1, 3, 5, 8] and [2, 4, 6, 9]
The final step is to merge these two arrays into one sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
The key point of merge sort is that it is a divide-and-conquer algorithm, which means that it divides the problem into smaller subproblems, 
solves them recursively, and then combines the solutions to the subproblems to form a solution to the original problem. 
The merge step is the key step in merge sort, as it combines the two sorted arrays back together in sorted order.

In terms of time and space complexity, merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(n)
